# Contributing

This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. The best place to start if you want to help is by [raising an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/Rapid-XAML-Toolkit/issues/new). Issues are where we propose, discuss, and track bugs and feature requests. If there's something you'd like to see added or even add yourself, start by raising an issue.

Before submitting a PR, please confirm that you have the legal permission to make the contribution. (i.e. It's not going to cause a problem with your employer.)

To get started making contributions, please read the [guide to working with the source](docs/getting-started.md#working-with-source).
